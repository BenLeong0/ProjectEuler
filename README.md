### These are my solutions for the mathematics and algorithm based projects hosted at https://projecteuler.net/.

If you are working through these problems yourself, it is highly advised that you do not look at problems that you have not completed yet yourself. There point of the questions are to practise working through problems of this kind, and viewing others' solutions greatly take away from this. As it says on the website:
> If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?
